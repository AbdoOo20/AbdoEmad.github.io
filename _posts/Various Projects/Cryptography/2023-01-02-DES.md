> # DES Cipher Using Python

# What is the DES Cipher?

It is one of the encryption techniques.<br>
DES stands for Data Encryption Standard. There are certain machines that can be used to crack the DES algorithm. The DES algorithm uses a key of 56-bit size. Using this key, the DES takes a block of 64-bit plain text as input and generates a block of 64-bit cipher text.
The DES process has several steps involved in it, where each step is called a round. Depending upon the size of the key being used, the number of rounds varies. For example, a 128-bit key requires 10 rounds, a 192-bit key requires 12 rounds, and so on...<br>

# Who it works?
It takes a key and a message and there are may modes in it. I used three modes only as shown in the code<br>
