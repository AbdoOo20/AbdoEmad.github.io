# Introduction
This challenge is called ClickMe. it is written in .NET

# How it works
- First, if you run the exe file (ClickMe) there is a message box will appear as the following:

- After clicking on "OK" there are three monsters you must beat them depending on their "hp" you must click "number of clicking" as the following:

</p>
- But the third monster requires to click 100.000.000 times to beat him as the following:

- So the first step is to know which language is that app is written to deal with so I used Detect it easy "DIE" to know as the following:
