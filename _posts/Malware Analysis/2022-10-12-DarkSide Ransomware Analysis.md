# Introduction  
Ransomware, is a type of malware that prevents users from accessing their system or files and demands that a ransom be paid to regain access.
Users are shown instructions on how to pay a ransom to obtain a decryption key to decrypt their files and get them back.

# What’s DarkSide Ransomware
-	The threat actors behind DarkSide ransomware are of Russian origin and are likely former affiliates of the REvil RaaS [ransomware-as-a-service] group.

-	DarkSide ransomware appeared in August 2020


-	DarkSide ransomware operates as a service(RaaS)

# Full Analysis
Here I did all aspects of Analysis so, I passed by Static, Dynamic, Advanced Static, and Advanced Dynamic analysis.<br> Supporting by Pictures from Analysis To help for reading easily. So, Let's Start.

# Advanced Static Analysis 

I faced many struggles while I was analyzing the assembly code by IDA Like:
- there are many loops  in functions
- The third function in the main function is so long And I didn't catch anything.
- There are no APIs That can help me in the analysis.
- There are many calls like "call dword-4208D0" so, it calls something from the data section and that is maybe resolving API functions and put addresses for these functions inside these addresses like "dword-4208D0" 
- Make an import address table for itself for making the analysis difficult for analysts.

# Advanced Dynamic Analysis 

- First of all this malware checks the installed language of the victim’s device as shonw:

- Then it loads Dlls and resolves Functions

- From Kernal32.dll it loads two functions “LoadLibraryA” and “GetProcAddress” for  resolving needed functions as shown:-<br>

- All dlls and resolved functions from them.

```
- After checking devices language and resolving APIs Functions that it needs, it looks for a mutex called “Global” if it exists, it shutdown and exit, and If it doesn’t exit, it creates a mutex with this name “Global” and keeps going for runnig. As shown :-

- Then it decodes a string "SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography" and this is a key in registry as shown :- <br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84356407/195852642-ab3eeaa8-b5a8-432f-bb0d-194d932b80d8.png" width="600">
- Then it gets machine GUID for this device to generate the extention for this malware as shown :- <br>

<br /><br />By examining this function 'KeyLogging_Fun' we can find :-

First : it creates a file called 'practicalmalwareanalysis.log' by calling 'CreateFileA' function to recode everything that you write on the keyboard then  as shown in the following picture:-

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84356407/178156194-7c894054-9572-416c-a875-18a7f2e2d63a.png" width="400">
<br /><br />Inside this file 'practicalmalwareanalysis.log' it recodes the window name that you open by calling this fun 'GetForegroundWindow' as shown in the following picture:-

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84356407/178156200-f85c2643-7757-425e-81a0-bf0c13c43d09.png" width="400">
<br /><br />It recodes the window name as the folloing pattern " [Window:  New Tab - window name]" as shown in the following picture:-<br /><br />
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84356407/178156205-ce6acb23-acbd-4761-ab3c-ad4c697ef822.png" width="400"><br />

<br />Then it recodes eveything that you write on the keyboard but it first make a comparission in some case by its switch cases to check if you cleck on 'BackSpace','Crtl' or numbers etc. Then it recodes these Keystrokes as shown in the following picture:-<br /><br />

<br /><br />Then it close the Handle for the file 'practicalmalwareanalysis.log' by calling 'CloseHandle' funcion as shown in the following picture:-<br />
