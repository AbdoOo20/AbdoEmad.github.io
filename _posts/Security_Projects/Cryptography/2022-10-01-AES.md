> # AES Cipher Using Python

# What is the AES Cipher?

It is one of the encryption techniques.<br>
The AES Encryption algorithm (also known as the Rijndael algorithm) is a symmetric block cipher algorithm with a block/chunk size of 128 bits. It converts these individual blocks using keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits. Once it encrypts these blocks, it joins them together to form the ciphertext.
It is based on a substitution-permutation network, also known as an SP network. It consists of a series of linked operations, including replacing inputs with specific outputs (substitutions) and others involving bit shuffling (permutations)..<br>

# Who it works?
It takes a key and a message and there are may modes in it. I used three modes only as shown in the code<br>
